------------------------------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>(Top 20 Python Interview Question)<<<<<<<<<<<<------------------------------------------------------

Question 1 :- Different Between List and Tuples ?

List: --->>>>>

1. List are Imuteable.
2. We can perform Updation, Deletion & Insertion 
3. List is slower then Tuple 
4. List consume more memory.

Tuple:---->>>>>>>

1. Tuples are Muteable
2. We can perform Updation , Deletion & Insertion.
3. Tuple is faster then List because its Immuteabilty
4. Tuple consume less memory as compare to list


Question 2 :- What is Defferent Between find and index in string

Find :- ----------->>>>>>>

1. Find is used to give the index value of a sequence.
2. Find is work only with string.
3. In find if our substring is not present then it give output (-1)

Index:  ------------>>>>>>

1. Index is also used to give the index value of 
2. Index will work string, Tuple as well as List
3. if our substring is not present in any sequence then it will give an error


Question 3 :- What is Different Between discard and remove ?

Remove:- -------->>>>>>>
 
1. Remove work with list and set as well
2. Remove will delete with give element from list or set
3. Remove will never give you delete element in list or set.If try to see the element then it will give output as None.
4. If the given element is not present in set or list then it will give an error

Discard:------>>>>>>>>>>

1. Discard work with only set
2. Discard is also used to delete the element in set
3. With Discard you also can't see the deleted element. If try to see the element then it will give output as None.
4. If the given element is not present in discard then it will give never give you an error. it will return same set as it as.


Question 4 :- What is Break , Contiune and Pass Statement and what it will do ?

Break :--->>>

1. Break will stop the iteration for that means if you are using break statement in any condition or loop then it will stop iteration 
   for that loop or condition.

Contiune ----->>>>>

1. Contiune will skip the element for that if you are using contiune statement in any condition or loop then it will skop iteration 
   for that loop or condition.

Pass --------->>>>>

1. Pass will do nothing if you are using pass statement inside any condition or loops then it will pass the element for that 

Question 5 :- What is means with Oops ?

Answer :- Oops stand for object Oriented Programing it just programing concept where each and every things will be bind in 
	  Object and classes.

Question 6 :- What is class and Object ?

Answer :-
 Class :- Binding the Data/Variables/ Properties and Method/Function in a single unit is nothing but an class
          and it is blue print of an object.
 	 
Object :- Any real world intity and physical exsitance of an class nothing but is an object. 


Question 7 :- What is Access Modifiers in Oops ?

Answer :- Access Modifier are keyword in Object Oriented Programing Language that are use to set the Access bility of classe and Method.

Question 8 :- What the types of Access Modifiers in Object Oriented Programing ?

Anwer :- 
1. Public Access Modifier  :- We can Access Public Access Modifier outside the class and indiside the class also.
2. Private Access Modifier :- We can Access Private Accesss Modifier only inside class only. If we want to access outside the class then we need to use getter and setter method.
3. Protected Access Modifier  :- We can Access Protected Access Modifier inside the class and inside the preants class and as well as child class.


Question 9 :-  What are different between Method Overriding and Overloading ?

Answer :-  Overloading :---->>> If any Method having same name with different argument then such type of concept know as Overloading .
	   Overinding :--->> If any Method Having same name with having same argument then such type of concept know as Overinding. 

Question 10 :- What is Runtime Polymorphism ?

Answer :- Whatever member are present inside preant class it will also present child class that the concept of Interiance but if child is not satisfy with preant class 
	  and child is want to implement own. so child can reimplement it own thats the concept of Runtime Polymorphis.


Question 11. Write a program to check whether a person is eligible for voting or not. (accept age from user)

Answer :- . 
	age=int(input("Enter your age"))
	if age >=18:
   	    print("Eligible for voting")
	else:
            print("not eligible for voting")

Question 12. How do I modify a string in python?

Answer :-  You can’t because strings are immutable in python. In most situations, you should simply construct a new string from the various parts
 	   you want to assemble it from. Work with them as lists; turn them into strings only when needed.

	>>> s = list("Hello zorld")
	>>> s
	['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'z', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
	>>> s[6] = 'W'
	>>> s
	['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
	>>> "".join(s)
	'Hello World' 

Question 13. Write a program to check whether a person is eligible for voting or not. (accept age from user)

Answer :- 
		age=int(input("Enter your age"))
		if age >=18:
   		   print("Eligible for voting")
		else:
  		   print("not eligible for voting")

Question 14. Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number. Go to the editor
Expected Output:

Answer :- Input a number: 5                                                       
          5 x 1 = 5                                                               
	  5 x 2 = 10                                                              
	  5 x 3 = 15

	  5 x 9 = 45                                                              
	  5 x 10 = 50 

Question 15. What are Keywords in Python?

Answer: Keywords in python are reserved words that have special meaning.They are generally used to define type of variables. Keywords cannot be used 
	for variable or function names. There are following 33 keywords in python-

And      False          Class
Try      None           Continue
With     Nonlocal       Del
Raise    Yield          Finally    
Assert   Except         From
Global   Or             Else
Import   Not		For 
In       If		While	
Is       Elif           Break
As	 Lambda		Return
Def      Pass		True

        
Question 16. What is __init__?
 Answer : __init__ is a contructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. 
	 All classes have a __init__ method associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from local variables.

	# class definition
	class Student:
   	     def __init__(self, fname, lname, age, section):
       	                        self.firstname = fname
       				self.lastname = lname
       				self.age = age
       				self.section = section
	
	# creating a new object
	stu1 = Student("Sara", "Ansh", 22, "A2")
	

Question 17. What is the use of self in Python?

Answer :----->>>Self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. 
		It binds the attributes with the given arguments. self is used in different places and often thought to be a keyword. But unlike in C++, 
		self is not a keyword in Python.

Question 18. What are the type of Inheritence ?

Answer :------>>>>> There are six types of Inheritence in which five are application in Python.
		 
		 1. Single Level Inheritence      }
		 2. Multi Level Inheritence 	  }
		 3. Multiple Inheritence	  }-------------------->>>>>In which these five are Application in Python
		 4. Hierchical Level Inheritence  }
		 5. Hybrid Level Inheritence	  }
		 6. Cycle Level Inheritence

Question 19. What are the core Pillars of Object Oriented Programming ?

Answer :------->>>>>>    1. Incapsulation
			 2. Polymorphims
			 3. Inheritence
			 4. Abstraction

Question 20. What is Supper Method in Python ?

Answer :---->>>> For overriding the method of child class method we use Supper Method.
